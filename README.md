Our app aims to alleviate the harmful effects of misdiagnosing and lack of preventative care of patients in the modern world. Using Large Language Models and Machine Learning Algorithms, our app takes
in user symptoms to create a comprehensive diagnosis with steps to prevent harmful affects. Our Machine Learning models focus on Diabetes, Heart Attacks, and Arthritis as those three diseases are
quite prevelant.
